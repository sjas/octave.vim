octave.vim
==========

My shot at a proper octave vim plugin.

Since Vundle just downloads just some 'half' plugin (i.e. no omnicomplete) when using 'Bundle "octave.vim"'... 

I decided to bundle up the things available to make my own. 

(Look up 'octave.vim' on vim scripts homepage, to see what went in here.)
